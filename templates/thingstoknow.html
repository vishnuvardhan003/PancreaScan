<section id="treatment">
    <h2>Treatments for Pancreatic Cancer</h2>
    <p>Treatment options depend on the stage of the cancer and the overall health of the patient:</p>
    
        <p><strong>Surgery</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Why It's Performed:</strong> Surgery is the only potential cure for pancreatic cancer but is only possible if the cancer is localized and hasn’t spread to other organs.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> The goal of surgery is to remove as much of the tumor as possible and potentially provide a cure if the cancer is found at an early stage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Chemotherapy</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Why It's Performed:</strong> Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. It can be used before surgery to shrink the tumor, after surgery to kill remaining cancer cells.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> To reduce tumor size, improve symptoms, or prolong survival. Chemotherapy may also be combined with other treatments for better results.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Radiation Therapy</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Why It's Performed:</strong> Radiation uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells or shrink tumors. It can be used before surgery to shrink the tumor, after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells, or as a palliative treatment to reduce symptoms like pain.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> To control tumor growth, relieve symptoms (such as pain or blockage), and help improve quality of life.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Targeted Therapy</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Why It's Performed:</strong> Targeted therapy involves drugs that specifically target cancer cells without affecting normal cells. These drugs target specific molecules involved in cancer cell growth and survival.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> To stimulate the immune system to attack and destroy cancer cells.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Palliative Care</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Why It's Performed:</strong> In cases where the cancer is in an advanced stage and cannot be cured, palliative care focuses on relieving symptoms, improving comfort, and enhancing the quality of life.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal:</strong> The goal is to improving quality of life and symptom management in advanced stages.</li>
        </ul>
